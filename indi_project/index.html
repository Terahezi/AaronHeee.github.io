This is an independent project. Written in Python, Tensorflow.
                        <li>Preprocessed raw data into Spark Dataset by implementing MapReduce operations on MovieLens dataset.</li>
                        <li>Retrieval: Built candidate generators by implementing content-based filtering and collaborative filtering via Matrix Factorization using SparkMLib, visualized item / query embedding by using PCA, experimented with different similarity measures and regularization methods.</li>
                        <li>Ranking: Ranked candidates by implementing a softmax deep neural network with negative sampling, incorporated side features to the ranking model.</li>
                        <li>Re-ranking: Experimented with factors to be concerned for re-ranking, e.g. warm-start, multi-task learning, fairness etc.</li>
                        <li>Built a web application by defining a RESTful-like API using Flask, built a HTTP/1.1-compliant, WSGI thread-pooled web server on a Spark cluster using CherryPy.</li>
