                        <li>Implemented Latent Factor Model algorithm on a books rating dataset.</li>
                        <li>Implemented Factorized Personalized Markoc Chain on a Steam reviews dataset for sequential recommendation.</li>
                        <li>Implemented Translation-based Recommender on a Steam reviews dataset for sequential recommendation.</li>
                        <li>Implemented Self-attentive Deep Neural Networks using ideas from Transformer on Steam reviews, Amazon Beauty/Games, MovieLens dataset for sequential recommendation.</li>

                        This work is to build a webserver that implements a subset of the HTTP/1.1 protocol which we call it TritonHTTP. The code is in C++.
                        <li>Implemented a client and a server based on a stream-oriented TCP protocol.</li>
                        <li>Appended features like reusing TCP connection for request and reply, using HTTP format as request and response message, allowing for pipelined requests.</li>
                        <li>Implemented error codes and custom error page to deal with various types of errors.</li>

<h3>COMPUTER VISION</h3>
<p class="cell">
<a class='title'><b>Pattern Recognition of Images</b></a><br/>
    Explore some segmentation models for satellite imagery feature detection such as u-net. Fine tune basic models and explore the best size for satellite imagery.
    I maintain this project for <a href="http://www.citorytech.com/">Citory Ltd.</a> as an intern, but for some commerce reasons, details cannot be provided.
    This project is supervised by <a href="zhangfan@citorytech.com">Dr. Fan Zhang</a>. <br/>

        Apply the algorithm about <a href="https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~matt/courses/cs563/talks/smartin/ffdeform.html">3D Free Form Deformation (FFD)</a> with the toolkit<a href="https://www.vtk.org/"> VTK</a>.
        Plus, utilizing the 3D Face Resruction model <a href="https://github.com/YadiraF/PRNet">PRNet</a>, we realize the workflow of 2D-Face -> 3D-Face -> 3D-FFD. It's a course project about
        visualization, working with <a href="https://rshcaroline.github.io/">Shihan Ran</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Wang-Yikai">Yikai Wang</a>.
        The report in Chinese is <a href="resource/ffd.pdf">here</a>.

    Adapted from the Berkeley Pac-Man Assignments originally created by John DeNero and Dan Klein.
    This is an AI course project to implement an agent to undertake specifical tasks, as well as to find the path to the end in mazes.
    What we do are: 1) implement path-search algorithms for DFS, BFS, UCS as well as A*, and 2) design effective heuristics.
