<a class='title' href="https://github.com/GithubEye/GithubEye"><b>GithubEye: A Social-network-based Search Engine for Github</b></a><br/>
    A content search service named GithubEye to help people find Github repos.
    Type your Github user name and your natural language description of what you are looking for.
    Our service returns you the sorted repo list based on your social relationship in github.
    This's a competition project in HACKxFDU, and contributor list is <a href="https://github.com/GithubEye/GithubEye">here</a>

<a class='title' href="http://www.citorytech.com/"><b>Large-scale Satellite Imagery Feature Detection</b></a><br/>
    Explore some segmentation models for satellite imagery feature detection such as u-net. Fine tune basic models and explore the best size for satellite imagery.
    I maintain this project for <a href="http://www.citorytech.com/">Citory Ltd.</a> as an intern, but for some commerce reasons, details cannot be provided.
    This project is supervised by <a href="zhangfan@citorytech.com">Dr. Fan Zhang</a>. <br/>

    <a class='title' href="https://github.com/AaronHeee/FDU-3D-Free-Form-Deformation"><b>3D Free Form Deformation (In Chinese)</b></a><br/>
        Apply the algorithm about <a href="https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~matt/courses/cs563/talks/smartin/ffdeform.html">3D Free Form Deformation (FFD)</a> with the toolkit<a href="https://www.vtk.org/"> VTK</a>.
        Plus, utilizing the 3D Face Resruction model <a href="https://github.com/YadiraF/PRNet">PRNet</a>, we realize the workflow of 2D-Face -> 3D-Face -> 3D-FFD. It's a course project about
        visualization, working with <a href="https://rshcaroline.github.io/">Shihan Ran</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Wang-Yikai">Yikai Wang</a>.
        The report in Chinese is <a href="resource/ffd.pdf">here</a>.

    Adapted from the Berkeley Pac-Man Assignments originally created by John DeNero and Dan Klein.
    This is an AI course project to implement an agent to undertake specifical tasks, as well as to find the path to the end in mazes.
    What we do are: 1) implement path-search algorithms for DFS, BFS, UCS as well as A*, and 2) design effective heuristics.
