                <li>Implemented Factorized Personalized Markov Chain and Translation-based Recommender on a Steam reviews dataset for sequential recommendation, compared with baseline model: Bayesian Personalized Ranking.</li>
                <li>Implemented Self-attentive Deep Neural Networks using ideas from Transformer on Steam reviews, Amazon Beauty/Games, MovieLens dataset for sequential recommendation.</li>
                <li>Introduce hidden variable to capture heterogeneous relationships among items, introduce multi-task learning for training.</li>
                <li>Introduce knowledge graph based context to item embeddings to capture item relations under sequential setting.</li>

                <a class="title" ><b>Visual Question Answering & Image Captioning</b></a><br/> Reimplemented and Improved VQA 2017 & 18 champion's work. Written in Pytorch <br/>
                <li>Implemented a baseline with simple CNN and RNN for feature extraction, element-wise summation for fusion and fully-connected neural networks for classification.</li>
                <li>Image captioning: Implemented pre-trained ResNet50 as encoder and LSTM as decoder.</li>
                <li>VQA17: Implemented faster-RCNN to extract bottom-up attention, implemented GRU to generate top-down attention weights.</li>
                <li>Improvements: Experimented with pre-trained word embeddings: Word2Vec, Fastext and GloVe. Fine-tuned bottom-up attention, used Adamax for optimization, applied dropout & gradient clipping, experimented with fusion methods.</li>
