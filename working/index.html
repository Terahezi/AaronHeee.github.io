                <a class="title" ><b>Check-out Recognition</b></a><br/> This work is done during my internship at Sunmi AI Lab. The primary development environment is using Docker container on a Ubuntu 16.04 machine. The framework used is mainly Pytorch. <br/> 
                <li>Developed a video streaming and preprocessing program by implementing a video parser using OpenCV.</li>
                <li>Developed image classification algorithm by applying Resnet on video frames.</li>
                <li>Developed object detection algorithm by applying RefineDet, created a two-stage model by combining Resnet50 with RefineDet512.</li>
                <li>Improved accuracy by 10.5% by implementing label smoothing, focal loss, learning rate warmup + cosine schedule, Ranger optimizer.</li>
                <li>Improved training speed by 500%, reduced model size by 33% by implementing distributed data parallel and mixed precision training on Nvidia Titan RTX P2 GPU compared with single GPU, data parallel, full precision setting.</li>
                <li>Visualized and explained how the model works by applying Grad-CAM, Guided-Grad-CAM.</li>
