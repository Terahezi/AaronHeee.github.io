                <a class="title" ><b>Check-out Recognition</b></a><br/> This work is done during my internship at Sunmi AI Lab. The primary development environment is using Docker container on a Ubuntu 16.04 machine. The framework used is mainly Pytorch. <br/> 
                <li>Developed an interactive, extendable video parser for parsing, selecting and cropping frames</li>
                <li>Applied VGGNet, Resnet, MobileNet, Densenet for coarse check-out classification on selected, cropped frames</li>
                <li>Applied YOLO, RefineDet for fine key-object detection, combined Resnet50 and RefineDet512 into a two-stage model</li>
                <li>Implemented label smothing, focal loss, learning rate warmup + cosine schedule, Ranger optimizer, improved frame-wise accuracy by 10.5%</li>
                <li>Applied distributed data parallel and mixed precision training on Nvidia Titan RTX P2 GPU, improved training speed by 500%, reduced model size by 33% compared with single GPU, data parallel, full precision setting</li>
                <li>Applied Grad-CAM, Guided-Grad-CAM for visualizion and explanation</li>
